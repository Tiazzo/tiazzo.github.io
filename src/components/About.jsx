                    My name is <strong>Mattia</strong>, I'm a <strong>25-year-old Italian</strong> with a passion for technology that goes back to my childhood—though, to be fair, I wasn't building rockets or hacking into anything at 15. My real journey started in university, where I studied <strong>computer science</strong> and gradually fell in love with the field.

                    It all began with an internship as a <strong>cloud engineer</strong>, and I was instantly hooked on cloud computing. After earning my degree, I worked as a <strong>cybersecurity consultant</strong> for one of Italy’s largest banks. Still hungry to learn, I went back to school for a second degree—this time in <strong>computer engineering</strong> with a focus on <strong>AI and data analytics</strong>. In my second year, I packed my bags and moved to Gothenburg, Sweden, for an <strong>exchange program</strong>.

                    I’d describe myself as <strong>genuinely curious</strong>—the kind of person who starts a thousand things and finishes a few, but always with passion. I've explored countless sports and instruments (currently obsessed with climbing), and I love <strong>connecting different domains</strong>. My strength lies in having a <strong>broad, horizontal skill set</strong> and a mindset that constantly asks: <em>how does this work—and how can I make it better?</em>
